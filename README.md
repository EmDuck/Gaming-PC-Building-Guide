# Part Picking
## Part picking is an overlooked part of custom PC building. It can seem easy to just mix parts together and call it a day, but there are several other factors that you want to pay attention to.
### (I would recommend using https://pcpartpicker.com for creating PC part lists. It checks for compatibility issues, is always being updated, automatically links products and their prices, and has a huge variety of parts.

## Picking your parts
![image](https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/06LiQJzDE1OdJcUdbgqwz1X-15..v1569470572.jpg)

The most asked question about part picking is, "Which part is the most important?" The answer? Every part is equally important. Each part plays an important role in your system, and missing just one could affect its overall performance, or cause it to not work entirely.

**How to pick your parts:** Ask discord servers in their build-help channels. Some active and reliable servers will be listed down here:
- PC PARADISE https://discord.gg/pcparadise
- PC HELP HUB https://discord.gg/fCsPAfuaHQ
- PC Building 101 https://discord.gg/Etzp7H9T

**disclaimer: we are not sponsored by these servers, these are just some good ass servers lol**

Obviously, there are more servers, but speaking from experience, these three are just some servers I recommend you start with. Again, PCPartPicker is a powerful tool that can help you assemble a basic part list with recommendations and compatibility issues, but you should always ask for help if you don't know what you're doing.

# Tools needed
## Contrary to popular belief, you don't need *that* many tools to build a PC.

### YOU WILL NEED:
- 1x Screwdriver 
 ‣ A flexible/magnetic/long one would be convenient, but a standard one should do. Usually, Philips #2 screwdrivers are the most recommended, but if you are using M.2 devices, you'll need a smaller screwdriver head, usually Phillips #0.
- 1x Desk/Flat surface (OPTIONAL: Desk mat)
 ‣ It's ill-advised to build a PC on the floor. Using an elevated surface like a desk or table makes it easier to get around your build and put things in their proper places. If you're going to build on a floor, build on a soft, but not deep, rug/carpet. Hardwood/tiled floors can scratch components like your motherboard, and deep carpeting can cause you to lose screws. Desk mats are commonly used to build PCs, as they can transform a hard table into a soft workplace, that can also help keep you organized.
- 1x Screw Tray
 ‣ This doesn't have to be a real screw tray, it can be a dinner plate, pill sorter, or something else that keeps your screws organized. Most screw trays are made of magnetic stainless steel, so a handy tip is to use something like a dry-erase marker to divide your tray and mark which screws belong to what.

Like I said, there really aren't that many things you need for building a PC. With that established, let's begin!

# Building the PC:

![image](

Let's start with the motherboard. Take the motherboard out of the box it came with. It should come in a bag. don't open the bag and take the physical motherboard out. Instead, gently lay it down on an open space on your working area.

Next up, check the rest of the box for accessories. You should find a bunch of them stashed away in there.

## YOU WILL (most likely) FIND:
### **A rectangular metal plate with different shaped holes in it**
![image](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41lLvdJmGqL._SR600%2C315_PIWhiteStrip%2CBottomLeft%2C0%2C35_SCLZZZZZZZ_FMpng_BG255%2C255%2C255.jpg)
- This is the IO Shield. On the upper left of your motherboard, you'll see a bunch of ports. The IO shield protects these ports, and also acts as a shield against dust. Take this out of the box.
  - If you don't find one, it is most likely already attached to your motherboard.
  - If you don't find one in your box or attached to your motherboard, don't panic. The IO shield is mainly for aesthetics, and not using it or not having one won't have a negative effect on your build.

### **A bag of 1 pair/2 pairs of tiny metal screws and cylinders**
![image](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/iWgAAOSw59hbLdqV/s-l640.jpg)
- These are the M.2 device screws and standoffs. If you are using any M.2 devices such as M.2 SSDs, M.2 Wi-Fi adapters, and more, then you'll need these. Take this out of the box.
  - If you are not using any M.2 devices, you'll not need these. If you are using M.2 devices and cannot find them, you'll have to purchase some third-party replacement ones from a retailer/used seller.

### **Foldable antennas/Non-Foldable antenna with cable**
![image](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51u2H7SbzNL._AC_SL1072_.jpg)
![image](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/Lo4AAOSwco1fcXmp/s-l640.jpg)
- These are the Wi-Fi antennae. They extend the Wi-Fi signal and are meant to boost Wi-Fi performance. If your motherboard comes with built-in Wi-Fi, then you'll see this device included with your motherboard. Take this out of the box.
  - If you don't find this, your motherboard does not have with built-in Wi-Fi, or your motherboard may have built-in antennae or comes with them pre-attached.
  - If you plan on using a wired connection such as ethernet, you don't need to worry about this.

### **Cables**
![image](https://cdn.sabrent.com/uploads/CB-SFR3-Main.jpg)
- These cables are the SATA-DATA cables. If you have any SATA devices that require these cables such as hard drives or SATA SSDs, you'll need these cables. Take them out of the motherboard.
  - If you don't find these cables and have SATA devices that require these cables, you'll have to purchase some third-party replacement ones from a retailer/used seller.

### **Paper**
![image](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/user-manual-7076290.jpg)
- This is your motherboard manual. you'll need to use this as a reference for the build. Take this out of the box.
  - If you don't have a manual, you can find it at the manufacturer's website. Type in the model of your motherboard and look for the board's manual download, then open the PDF for your reference.
  - Anything else that you find made out of paper will probably be a quick start guide, a sticker, warranty notes, or a thank you note. You don't have to worry about those.

### **A disk**
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/713150258951225395/918240664435695656/20211208_153949.jpg)
- This is a DVD drive for your motherboard's drivers. I wouldn't recommend using this to install your motherboard's drivers because, one, it's probably out of date, as product manufacturers will have products sitting around for months on end until someone orders it, and two, you'll need to add an optical disk drive to your system, and that can be a pain and is unnecessary for more modern systems. Just let it sit in the box for now.
  - If you don't have this, don't worry. You'll install drivers for your motherboard later from the manufacturer's website either way.

### Once you find everything you need, head on to the next step. Close the motherboard box fully, and get your motherboard. Gently open the bag, and lay the motherboard down on top of the box, it provides a nice elevated surface to get started on.

## **Installing the Processor/CPU**

First, take your processor out of its box. Be gentle with it.
- Your processor will come in a plastic shell, but don't take it out yet. Gently set it down on an empty space on your workspace.
  - If there is a stock cooler inside and you're using it, take it out as well and place it down on your workspace.
  - Be aware that the stock cooler (usually) has pre-applied thermal paste on the bottom of the heatsink, so don't let that touch the table or you. If you get some paste on your hands, just lay down the cooler and go wash your hands.

## **[CLICK ME IF YOU ARE INSTALLING AMD AM4](https://github.com/Duck-Inc/PC-Building-Guide/blob/main/GUIDE.md#amd-am4-installation)**

### Intel LGA 1151/1200 Installation

Locate the CPU socket. It should be at the upper middle part of your motherboard.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918247505790119986/unknown.png)

There should be a cover on the socket. don't remove this, it'll come off on its own later when we install the CPU.
- On the socket cover, you should see a tiny triangle on one of the corners. Locate and remember the position of it.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918257217206108260/unknown.png)

Now, next to the socket, there should be a metal lever being held down.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918248332030263306/unknown.png)

On the very bottom of the lever, push down and to the right until the lever isn't being held down anymore.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918249330312376320/unknown.png)

Now, lift the lever all the way up to the top. You should now see an exposed socket.
- **DO NOT TOUCH THE SOCKET.**

![image](https://static.techspot.com/images2/news/bigimage/2020/04/2020-04-23-image-13.jpg)

After you've done that, take the processor and remove it from its plastic shell.

- **BE EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS WHILE DOING THIS. IF YOU USE TOO MUCH FORCE, THE PROCESSOR CAN FLY OUT OF THE SHELL WHEN YOU OPEN IT, AND IT MIGHT CAUSE PHYSICAL DAMAGE.**

Grab the processor by its sides. don't touch the top with the text or the bottom with the golden contacts.
- You can use two hands and grab each corner with one finger.

![image](https://gamingcpus.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/what-is-cpu-in-pc.jpg)

Now, find the golden triangle on the corners of your processor.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918253281933946970/unknown.png)

Once you've found it, lower the processor down into the motherboard socket with the triangle in the same spot as the socket cover's triangle was.
- For example, my socket cover's triangle was on the bottom left, so the processor's triangle has to face the bottom left.

Grabbing the processor by the sides, lower it down into the socket.
- Don't drop it in from a distance.
- If it doesn't fit in the socket, you are not lining up the processor's triangle with the socket triangle.

![image](https://hackster.imgix.net/uploads/attachments/419192/how_to_install_a_processor_into_a_motherboard_4fQ4w2mURA.jpg?auto=compress&w=900&h=675&fit=min&fm=jpg)

Once it is in, make sure the processor sits flush with the socket.
- **DO NOT FORCE THE PROCESSOR IN.**
- If you are feeling unsure about it being completely in the socket, you can give it a little wiggle, no more than that.

![image](https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/install-intel-cpu-motherboard-100748992-orig-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&quality=50&strip=all)

Next, you can lower the socket cover until the flap sits under the screw.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918258193421992047/unknown.png)

Finally, bring the lever towards you.
- Push the lever down, and when you cannot push it down any further, push it towards the left until the handle of the lever is locked under the metal bar.
- The socket cover will pop off during this process. Don't worry, you didn't break anything. This is perfectly normal.
- If the socket didn't pop off, manually take it off yourself, although being careful in the process.
  - Make sure to hold onto the socket cover. If your motherboard is faulty, you will need to send it back with the socket cover.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918259697688117258/unknown.png)

Congratulations! You've installed an Intel processor.

### AMD AM4 Installation

Locate the CPU socket. It should be at the upper middle part of your motherboard.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918261151324835930/unknown.png)

On one of the corners of the socket, there will be a small triangle. 
- Locate and remember the position of this triangle.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918323706672058418/unknown.png)

Now, next to the socket, there should be a metal lever being held down.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918261395961815110/unknown.png)

On the very left of the lever, push down and towards you until the lever isn't being held down anymore.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918262051716100148/unknown.png)

Now, push the lever all the way to the right. You should see the rubber socket slightly move.

![image](https://cdn.levvvel.com/wp-content/uploads/am4-cpu-list.jpg)

After you've done that, take the processor and remove it from its plastic shell.

- **BE EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS WHILE DOING THIS. IF YOU USE TOO MUCH FORCE, THE PROCESSOR CAN FLY OUT OF THE SHELL WHEN YOU OPEN IT, AND IT MIGHT CAUSE PHYSICAL DAMAGE.**

Grab the processor by its sides. don't touch the top with the text or the bottom with the golden pins.
- You can use two hands and grab each corner with one finger.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918602455225348166/unknown.png)

Now, find the golden triangle on the corners of your processor.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918603263807475762/unknown.png)

Once you've found it, lower the processor down into the motherboard socket with the triangle in the same spot as the socket's triangle was.
- For example, my socket cover's triangle was on the top left, so the processor's triangle has to face the top left.

Grabbing the processor by the sides, lower it down into the socket.
- don't drop it in from a distance.
- If it doesn't fit in the socket, you are not lining up the processor's triangle with the socket triangle.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918602455225348166/unknown.png)

Once it is in, make sure the processor sits flush with the socket.
- **don't FORCE THE PROCESSOR IN.**
- If you are feeling unsure about it being completely in the socket, you can give it a little wiggle, no more than that.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/919346331108126790/unknown.png)

Finally, bring the lever towards you.
- Push the lever all the way down until it sits underneath the rubber tab.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/919347220631920740/unknown.png)

Congratulations! You've installed an AMD processor.

## **Installing the Memory**

![image](https://www.crucial.com/content/dam/crucial/dram-products/ballistix-udimm/images/in-use/Crucial-Ballistix-Standard-in-use-Image.psd.transform/small-jpg/img.jpg)

Locate the memory slots. They should be to the right of your processor. These slots are called DIMM slots.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/925449838764630056/unknown.png)

Open your memory kit. You should find either one, two, or four sticks in your kit.

## **[CLICK ME IF YOU HAVE ONE STICK OF MEMORY](https://github.com/Duck-Inc/PC-Building-Guide/blob/main/GUIDE.md#installing-one-stick-of-memory)**
## **[CLICK ME IF YOU HAVE TWO STICKS OF MEMORY](https://github.com/Duck-Inc/PC-Building-Guide/blob/main/GUIDE.md#installing-two-sticks-of-memory)**
## **[CLICK ME IF YOU HAVE FOUR STICKS OF MEMORY](https://github.com/Duck-Inc/PC-Building-Guide/blob/main/GUIDE.md#installing-one-stick-of-memory-1)**

### Installing **one** stick of Memory

![image](https://www.gskill.com/_upload/images/153596849810.png)

Open your motherboard's manual and locate the RAM/Memory installation section. It should tell you to install the memory in either slots A1, A2, B1, or B2.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/925453517320253480/unknown.png)

Once you've located which slot you should install the memory stick in, locate the tabs on the side.

![image](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2AmLDGOD5TgqUjSG.medium)

For the slot that you'll be installing your memory stick in, open the tabs by gently pushing them away from the memory slot.
- If you cannot open one of the tabs, then your motherboard was designed to only open one tab. You can move on to the next step if you've confirmed it won't budge.
  - If it won't open and was designed to open both tabs, it may be damaged/manufacturer had a bad day.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/925454731487359046/unknown.png)

Next, you should see a notch on each DIMM slot of your motherboard. When you install your memory, this notch will align with the keyed hole on your memory stick.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/925459895501860965/unknown.png)

Finally, gently lower your memory stick down into the DIMM slot. Once again, make sure the notch is aligned with the keyed hole on your memory stick.

![image](https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/put-computer-memory-ddr-ram-in-the-slot-of-motherboard-picture-id854429666)

Once both sides of your memory stick sits flush with the DIMM slot, use even pressure and push down on the stick to lock it in.
- don't be afraid to do this. Put two fingers on each side of the stick and go straight down.
- You should hear two clicks when it's fully locked in.

![image](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/inserting-ram.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=2400&dpr=1.5)

If your memory is fully installed, you should see the tabs on the side should close back.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/925461271430717450/unknown.png)

Congratulations! You've installed your memory.

### Installing **two** sticks of Memory

![image](https://media.pangoly.com/img/a/c/7/9/ac79f8ec-3b6d-4c79-b382-ff09afb5d32e.jpg)

Open your motherboard's manual and locate the RAM/Memory installation section. It should tell you to install the memory in either slots A1, A2, B1, or B2.
- For some motherboards, you can see where to install two sticks of memory directly.

![image](https://www.build-gaming-computers.com/images/where-to-install-dual-channel-ram-modules.jpg)

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/925453517320253480/unknown.png)

Once you've located which slots you should install the memory stick in, locate the tabs on the side.

![image](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2AmLDGOD5TgqUjSG.medium)

For the slot that you'll be installing your memory stick in, open the tabs on both ends by gently pushing them away from the memory slot.
- If you cannot open one of the tabs, then your motherboard was designed to only open one tab. You can move on to the next step if you've confirmed it won't budge.
  - If it won't open and was designed to open both tabs, it may be damaged/manufacturer had a bad day.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/925454731487359046/unknown.png)

### Installing **one** stick of Memory

![image](https://www.gskill.com/_upload/images/156283150611.png)

For 4 sticks of memory, you can just fill up each DIMM slot with one stick.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/925453517320253480/unknown.png)
