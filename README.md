**Hello there! Welcome to the wonderful world of custom PC building. Don't worry, this is easy. It's basically legos but for adults.**

Before we start building, let's get you ready.

## **Installing the Processor/CPU**

First, take your processor out of its box. Be gentle with it.
- Your processor will come in a plastic shell, but don't take it out yet. Gently set it down on an empty space on your workspace.
  - If there is a stock cooler inside and you're using it, take it out as well and place it down on your workspace.
  - Be aware that the stock cooler (usually) has pre-applied thermal paste on the bottom of the heatsink, so don't let that touch the table or you. If you get some paste on your hands, just lay down the cooler and go wash your hands.

## **[CLICK ME IF YOU ARE INSTALLING AMD AM4](https://github.com/Duck-Inc/PC-Building-Guide/blob/main/GUIDE.md#amd-am4-installation)**

### Intel LGA 1151/1200 Installation

Locate the CPU socket. It should be at the upper middle part of your motherboard.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918247505790119986/unknown.png)

There should be a cover on the socket. don't remove this, it'll come off on its own later when we install the CPU.
- On the socket cover, you should see a tiny triangle on one of the corners. Locate and remember the position of it.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918257217206108260/unknown.png)

Now, next to the socket, there should be a metal lever being held down.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918248332030263306/unknown.png)

On the very bottom of the lever, push down and to the right until the lever isn't being held down anymore.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918249330312376320/unknown.png)

Now, lift the lever all the way up to the top. You should now see an exposed socket.
- **DO NOT TOUCH THE SOCKET.**

![image](https://static.techspot.com/images2/news/bigimage/2020/04/2020-04-23-image-13.jpg)

After you've done that, take the processor and remove it from its plastic shell.

- **BE EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS WHILE DOING THIS. IF YOU USE TOO MUCH FORCE, THE PROCESSOR CAN FLY OUT OF THE SHELL WHEN YOU OPEN IT, AND IT MIGHT CAUSE PHYSICAL DAMAGE.**

Grab the processor by its sides. don't touch the top with the text or the bottom with the golden contacts.
- You can use two hands and grab each corner with one finger.

![image](https://gamingcpus.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/what-is-cpu-in-pc.jpg)

Now, find the golden triangle on the corners of your processor.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918253281933946970/unknown.png)

Once you've found it, lower the processor down into the motherboard socket with the triangle in the same spot as the socket cover's triangle was.
- For example, my socket cover's triangle was on the bottom left, so the processor's triangle has to face the bottom left.

Grabbing the processor by the sides, lower it down into the socket.
- Don't drop it in from a distance.
- If it doesn't fit in the socket, you are not lining up the processor's triangle with the socket triangle.

Once it is in, make sure the processor sits flush with the socket.
- **DO NOT FORCE THE PROCESSOR IN.**
- If you are feeling unsure about it being completely in the socket, you can give it a little wiggle, no more than that.

![image](https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/install-intel-cpu-motherboard-100748992-orig-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&quality=50&strip=all)

Next, you can lower the socket cover until the flap sits under the screw.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918258193421992047/unknown.png)

Finally, bring the lever towards you.
- Push the lever down, and when you cannot push it down any further, push it towards the left until the handle of the lever is locked under the metal bar.
- The socket cover will pop off during this process. Don't worry, you didn't break anything. This is perfectly normal.
- If the socket didn't pop off, manually take it off yourself, although being careful in the process.
  - Make sure to hold onto the socket cover. If your motherboard is faulty, you will need to send it back with the socket cover.

### AMD AM4 Installation

Locate the CPU socket. It should be at the upper middle part of your motherboard.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918261151324835930/unknown.png)

On one of the corners of the socket, there will be a small triangle. 
- Locate and remember the position of this triangle.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918323706672058418/unknown.png)

Now, next to the socket, there should be a metal lever being held down.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918261395961815110/unknown.png)

On the very left of the lever, push down and towards you until the lever isn't being held down anymore.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918262051716100148/unknown.png)

Now, push the lever all the way to the right. You should see the rubber socket slightly move.

![image](https://cdn.levvvel.com/wp-content/uploads/am4-cpu-list.jpg)

After you've done that, take the processor and remove it from its plastic shell.

- **BE EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS WHILE DOING THIS. IF YOU USE TOO MUCH FORCE, THE PROCESSOR CAN FLY OUT OF THE SHELL WHEN YOU OPEN IT, AND IT MIGHT CAUSE PHYSICAL DAMAGE.**

Grab the processor by its sides. don't touch the top with the text or the bottom with the golden pins.
- You can use two hands and grab each corner with one finger.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918602455225348166/unknown.png)

Now, find the golden triangle on the corners of your processor.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918603263807475762/unknown.png)

Once you've found it, lower the processor down into the motherboard socket with the triangle in the same spot as the socket's triangle was.
- For example, my socket cover's triangle was on the top left, so the processor's triangle has to face the top left.

Grabbing the processor by the sides, lower it down into the socket.
- don't drop it in from a distance.
- If it doesn't fit in the socket, you are not lining up the processor's triangle with the socket triangle.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918602455225348166/unknown.png)

- **don't FORCE THE PROCESSOR IN.**
- If you are feeling unsure about it being completely in the socket, you can give it a little wiggle, no more than that.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/919346331108126790/unknown.png)

Finally, bring the lever towards you.
- Push the lever all the way down until it sits underneath the rubber tab.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/919347220631920740/unknown.png)

Congratulations! You've installed an AMD processor.

## **Installing the Memory**

![image](https://www.crucial.com/content/dam/crucial/dram-products/ballistix-udimm/images/in-use/Crucial-Ballistix-Standard-in-use-Image.psd.transform/small-jpg/img.jpg)

Locate the memory slots. They should be to the right of your processor. These slots are called DIMM slots.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/925449838764630056/unknown.png)

Open your memory kit. You should find either one, two, or four sticks in your kit.

## **[CLICK ME IF YOU HAVE ONE STICK OF MEMORY](https://github.com/Duck-Inc/PC-Building-Guide/blob/main/GUIDE.md#installing-one-stick-of-memory)**
## **[CLICK ME IF YOU HAVE TWO STICKS OF MEMORY](https://github.com/Duck-Inc/PC-Building-Guide/blob/main/GUIDE.md#installing-two-sticks-of-memory)**
## **[CLICK ME IF YOU HAVE FOUR STICKS OF MEMORY](https://github.com/Duck-Inc/PC-Building-Guide/blob/main/GUIDE.md#installing-one-stick-of-memory-1)**

### Installing **one** stick of Memory

![image](https://www.gskill.com/_upload/images/153596849810.png)

Open your motherboard's manual and locate the RAM/Memory installation section. It should tell you to install the memory in either slots A1, A2, B1, or B2.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/925453517320253480/unknown.png)

Once you've located which slot you should install the memory stick in, locate the tabs on the side.

![image](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2AmLDGOD5TgqUjSG.medium)

For the slot that you'll be installing your memory stick in, open the tabs by gently pushing them away from the memory slot.
- If you cannot open one of the tabs, then your motherboard was designed to only open one tab. You can move on to the next step if you've confirmed it won't budge.
  - If it won't open and was designed to open both tabs, it may be damaged/manufacturer had a bad day.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/925454731487359046/unknown.png)

Next, you should see a notch on each DIMM slot of your motherboard. When you install your memory, this notch will align with the keyed hole on your memory stick.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/925459895501860965/unknown.png)

Finally, gently lower your memory stick down into the DIMM slot. Once again, make sure the notch is aligned with the keyed hole on your memory stick.

![image](https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/put-computer-memory-ddr-ram-in-the-slot-of-motherboard-picture-id854429666)

Once both sides of your memory stick sits flush with the DIMM slot, use even pressure and push down on the stick to lock it in.
- don't be afraid to do this. Put two fingers on each side of the stick and go straight down.
- You should hear two clicks when it's fully locked in.

![image](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/inserting-ram.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=2400&dpr=1.5)

If your memory is fully installed, you should see the tabs on the side should close back.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/925461271430717450/unknown.png)

Congratulations! You've installed your memory.

### Installing **two** sticks of Memory

![image](https://media.pangoly.com/img/a/c/7/9/ac79f8ec-3b6d-4c79-b382-ff09afb5d32e.jpg)

Open your motherboard's manual and locate the RAM/Memory installation section. It should tell you to install the memory in either slots A1, A2, B1, or B2.
- For some motherboards, you can see where to install two sticks of memory directly.

![image](https://www.build-gaming-computers.com/images/where-to-install-dual-channel-ram-modules.jpg)

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/925453517320253480/unknown.png)

Once you've located which slots you should install the memory stick in, locate the tabs on the side.

![image](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2AmLDGOD5TgqUjSG.medium)

For the slot that you'll be installing your memory stick in, open the tabs on both ends by gently pushing them away from the memory slot.
- If you cannot open one of the tabs, then your motherboard was designed to only open one tab. You can move on to the next step if you've confirmed it won't budge.
  - If it won't open and was designed to open both tabs, it may be damaged/manufacturer had a bad day.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/925454731487359046/unknown.png)

### Installing **one** stick of Memory

![image](https://www.gskill.com/_upload/images/156283150611.png)

For 4 sticks of memory, you can just fill up each DIMM slot with one stick.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/925453517320253480/unknown.png)

### Intel Stock Cooler installation

![image](https://www.techpowerup.com/img/F1SUkJmaJ1f1QZbZ.jpg)

Take the cooler and align the 4 legs with the holes on your motherboard. you'll find those around your processor's socket.
- Make sure the cooler's sticker on the fan is facing straight.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/919365882839441448/unknown.png)

Once the legs of the cooler are properly aligned with the holes, push down on the tabs to lock the cooler in.
