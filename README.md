## **THIS IS A GUIDE TARGETED AT STANDARD ATX/MICRO-ATX BUILDS ONLY. INFORMATION ABOUT MINI-ITX, CUSTOM WATER COOLING LOOPS (NOT ALL-IN-ONE WATERCOOLERS) AND SUCH TOPICS WILL NOT BE FOUND HERE.**

## **PLEASE READ EVERY STEP AND PIECE OF INFORMATION CAREFULLY. FAILURE TO DO SO WILL LEAD TO POTENTIAL SYSTEM FAILURE, AND THE GUIDE MAKER WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY REPROCUSSIONS.**

### Inspired by [Ozone](https://github.com/ozone3950) and [Arshia's](https://github.com/Arshia1381) guides. Special thanks to [PCParadise](https://discord.com/invite/pcparadise) for the awesome support and friendships made there.
