# Building

Welcome to the fun part of this guide, building the system!

Are you scared?

Good!

I'm joking. This is relatively simple, just follow directions and you'll survive.

## Tools needed

You don't need many tools.

### YOU WILL NEED:
- 1x **Screwdriver**
  - You'll need a Phillips head screwdriver. [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=philips+head+screwdrivers&crid=1SDNETJCKJ11F&sprefix=philips+head+%2Caps%2C83&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_4_13) has several options priced affordably.
  - Magnetic tip and/or electrical screwdrivers are more convenient than standard screwdrivers, but it doesn't really matter.

- 1x **[Desk](https://youtu.be/2lmfF0k2UcU?t=24)** ([Verge reference haha](https://youtu.be/M-2Scfj4FZk?t=67))
  - Seriously, though. I wouldn't recommend building a PC on the floor, especially on carpet. Screws get lost easily and sitting down for hours building just hurts your ass and back. 

Like I said, there really aren't that many things you need for building a PC. With that done, let's begin!

### Building the PC:

#### Unboxing the motherboard

Let's start with the motherboard.

- Take the motherboard out of the box it came with. It should come in a bag.
- Gently lay it down to your side. We'll come back for it later.

Next up, check the rest of the box for accessories. You should find a bunch of them stashed away in there.

#### You will (most likely) find:

##### **IO Shield**
![image](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41lLvdJmGqL._SR600%2C315_PIWhiteStrip%2CBottomLeft%2C0%2C35_SCLZZZZZZZ_FMpng_BG255%2C255%2C255.jpg)

This is the **IO Shield**. Take this out of the box.

- If you don't find one, it's probably already attached to your motherboard. Some manufacturers do this. 
- If you don't find one at all, don't worry. The IO shield is for aesthetical purposes. You can always buy one for your specific motherboard on [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1313&_nkw=%28motherboard+model+here%29+io+shield&_sacat=0).

##### **M.2 SSD Screws & Standoffs**

![image](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/iWgAAOSw59hbLdqV/s-l640.jpg)

These are the **M.2 SSD screws and standoffs**. 

- If you are using any M.2 form factor devices such as M.2 SSDs, M.2 Wi-Fi, etc, then you'll need these. Take it out of the box.
- If you are **not** using any M.2 devices, you don't need these.
- If you **are** using M.2 devices and can't find them, you'll have to purchase some third-party replacements.

##### **WiFi Antennae**
![image](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51u2H7SbzNL._AC_SL1072_.jpg)
![image](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/Lo4AAOSwco1fcXmp/s-l640.jpg)

- These are the **Wi-Fi antennae**. If your motherboard has **built-in Wi-Fi**, then you'll see these included with your motherboard. Take it out of the box.
- If you don't find this, your motherboard **does not have with built-in Wi-Fi**.
- If you plan on **using a wired connection such as ethernet**, you don't need to worry about this.

##### **SATA-DATA Cables**
![image](https://cdn.sabrent.com/uploads/CB-SFR3-Main.jpg)

These are the **SATA-DATA** cables. Take these out of the box only if you have non-M.2 SSDs/Hard Drives.

- If you don't find these cables and have devices that require these cables, you'll have to purchase some replacements ones from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=sata+data+cables&crid=33QSFSUDHIDG2&sprefix=sata+data+cables%2Caps%2C74&ref=nb_sb_noss_1).

##### **Manual**

![image](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/user-manual-7076290.jpg)

This is your **motherboard manual**. Take this out of the box.

- You probably won't need this, but the guide is not made for all user scenarios. Therefore, you should have this around for a reference.
- If you don't have a manual, you can find it at the manufacturer's website. 
  - Here's a video showing how to do that.
- Anything else that you find made out of paper will probably be a quick start guide, a sticker, warranty notes, or a thank you note. You don't have to worry about those except for warranty (if you somehow manage to break your motherboard).

##### **Driver Disk*
![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/713150258951225395/918240664435695656/20211208_153949.jpg)

This is a DVD drive containing your motherboard's drivers. Leave this in the box.

- I wouldn't recommend using this to install your motherboard's drivers because the drivers on there are most likely very out of date.
  - Also, you'll need an optical disk drive and most modern cases don't support those.

 If you don't have this, you really do not need to be concerned.

### Once you find everything you need, head on to the next step. Close the motherboard box fully, and get your motherboard. Gently open the bag, and lay the motherboard down on top of the box, it provides a nice elevated surface to get started on.

## **Installing the Processor/CPU**

Before you do anything, take your motherboard out of its plastic bag and place it on top of its box.

Now, you may take your processor out of its box. Don't drop it. 

- Your processor will come in a plastic shell, but don't take it out yet. Gently set it down next to you.
  - If there is a stock cooler inside and you're using it, take it out as well and place it down on your workspace.
  - Be aware that the stock cooler (usually) has pre-applied thermal paste on the bottom of the heatsink, so don't let that touch the table or you. If you get some paste on your hands, just lay down the cooler and go wash your hands.

### AMD AM4 Installation

Locate the CPU socket. It should be at the upper middle part of your motherboard.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918261151324835930/unknown.png)

On one of the corners of the socket, there will be a small triangle. 
- Locate and remember the position of this triangle.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918323706672058418/unknown.png)

Now, next to the socket, there should be a metal lever being held down.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918261395961815110/unknown.png)

On the very left of the lever, push down and towards you until the lever isn't being held down anymore.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918262051716100148/unknown.png)

Now, push the lever all the way to the right. You should see the rubber socket slightly move.

![image](https://cdn.levvvel.com/wp-content/uploads/am4-cpu-list.jpg)

After you've done that, take the processor and remove it from its plastic shell.

- **BE EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS WHILE DOING THIS. IF YOU USE TOO MUCH FORCE, THE PROCESSOR CAN FLY OUT OF THE SHELL WHEN YOU OPEN IT, AND IT MIGHT CAUSE PHYSICAL DAMAGE.**

Grab the processor by its sides. don't touch the top with the text or the bottom with the golden pins.
- You can use two hands and grab each corner with one finger.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918602455225348166/unknown.png)

Now, find the golden triangle on the corners of your processor.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918603263807475762/unknown.png)

Once you've found it, lower the processor down into the motherboard socket with the triangle in the same spot as the socket's triangle was.
- For example, my socket cover's triangle was on the top left, so the processor's triangle has to face the top left.

Grabbing the processor by the sides, lower it down into the socket.
- don't drop it in from a distance.
- If it doesn't fit in the socket, you are not lining up the processor's triangle with the socket triangle.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918602455225348166/unknown.png)

Once it is in, make sure the processor sits flush with the socket.
- **don't FORCE THE PROCESSOR IN.**
- If you are feeling unsure about it being completely in the socket, you can give it a little wiggle, no more than that.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/919346331108126790/unknown.png)

Finally, bring the lever towards you.
- Push the lever all the way down until it sits underneath the rubber tab.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/919347220631920740/unknown.png)

Congratulations! You've installed an AMD processor.

##### **[Click me to go to the next step!](https://github.com/Duck-Inc/PC-Building-Guide/blob/main/GUIDE.md#installing-the-cooler)**

### Intel LGA 1151/1200 Installation

Locate the CPU socket. It should be at the upper middle part of your motherboard.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918247505790119986/unknown.png)

There should be a cover on the socket. don't remove this, it'll come off on its own later when we install the CPU.
- On the socket cover, you should see a tiny triangle on one of the corners. Locate and remember the position of it.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918257217206108260/unknown.png)

Now, next to the socket, there should be a metal lever being held down.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918248332030263306/unknown.png)

On the very bottom of the lever, push down and to the right until the lever isn't being held down anymore.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918249330312376320/unknown.png)

Now, lift the lever all the way up to the top. You should now see an exposed socket.
- **DO NOT TOUCH THE SOCKET.**

![image](https://static.techspot.com/images2/news/bigimage/2020/04/2020-04-23-image-13.jpg)

After you've done that, take the processor and remove it from its plastic shell.

- **BE EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS WHILE DOING THIS. IF YOU USE TOO MUCH FORCE, THE PROCESSOR CAN FLY OUT OF THE SHELL WHEN YOU OPEN IT, AND IT MIGHT CAUSE PHYSICAL DAMAGE.**

Grab the processor by its sides. don't touch the top with the text or the bottom with the golden contacts.
- You can use two hands and grab each corner with one finger.

![image](https://gamingcpus.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/what-is-cpu-in-pc.jpg)

Now, find the golden triangle on the corners of your processor.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918253281933946970/unknown.png)

Once you've found it, lower the processor down into the motherboard socket with the triangle in the same spot as the socket cover's triangle was.
- For example, my socket cover's triangle was on the bottom left, so the processor's triangle has to face the bottom left.

Grabbing the processor by the sides, lower it down into the socket.
- Don't drop it in from a distance.
- If it doesn't fit in the socket, you are not lining up the processor's triangle with the socket triangle.

Once it is in, make sure the processor sits flush with the socket.
- **DO NOT FORCE THE PROCESSOR IN.**
- If you are feeling unsure about it being completely in the socket, you can give it a little wiggle, no more than that.

![image](https://www.pcworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/install-intel-cpu-motherboard-100748992-orig-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C678&quality=50&strip=all)

Next, you can lower the socket cover until the flap sits under the screw.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918258193421992047/unknown.png)

Finally, bring the lever towards you.
- Push the lever down, and when you cannot push it down any further, push it towards the left until the handle of the lever is locked under the metal bar.
- The socket cover will pop off during this process. Don't worry, you didn't break anything. This is perfectly normal.
- If the socket didn't pop off, manually take it off yourself, although being careful in the process.
  - Make sure to hold onto the socket cover. If your motherboard is faulty, you will need to send it back with the socket cover.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/918259697688117258/unknown.png)

Congratulations! You've installed an Intel processor.

## **Installing the Memory**

![image](https://www.crucial.com/content/dam/crucial/dram-products/ballistix-udimm/images/in-use/Crucial-Ballistix-Standard-in-use-Image.psd.transform/small-jpg/img.jpg)

Locate the memory slots. They should be to the right of your processor. These slots are called DIMM slots.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/925449838764630056/unknown.png)

Open your memory kit. You should find either one, two, or four sticks in your kit.

## **[CLICK ME IF YOU HAVE ONE STICK OF MEMORY](https://github.com/Duck-Inc/PC-Building-Guide/blob/main/GUIDE.md#installing-one-stick-of-memory)**
## **[CLICK ME IF YOU HAVE TWO STICKS OF MEMORY](https://github.com/Duck-Inc/PC-Building-Guide/blob/main/GUIDE.md#installing-two-sticks-of-memory)**
## **[CLICK ME IF YOU HAVE FOUR STICKS OF MEMORY](https://github.com/Duck-Inc/PC-Building-Guide/blob/main/GUIDE.md#installing-one-stick-of-memory-1)**

### Installing **one** stick of Memory

![image](https://www.gskill.com/_upload/images/153596849810.png)

Open your motherboard's manual and locate the RAM/Memory installation section. It should tell you to install the memory in either slots A1, A2, B1, or B2.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/925453517320253480/unknown.png)

Once you've located which slot you should install the memory stick in, locate the tabs on the side.

![image](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2AmLDGOD5TgqUjSG.medium)

For the slot that you'll be installing your memory stick in, open the tabs by gently pushing them away from the memory slot.
- If you cannot open one of the tabs, then your motherboard was designed to only open one tab. You can move on to the next step if you've confirmed it won't budge.
  - If it won't open and was designed to open both tabs, it may be damaged/manufacturer had a bad day.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/925454731487359046/unknown.png)

Next, you should see a notch on each DIMM slot of your motherboard. When you install your memory, this notch will align with the keyed hole on your memory stick.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/925459895501860965/unknown.png)

Finally, gently lower your memory stick down into the DIMM slot. Once again, make sure the notch is aligned with the keyed hole on your memory stick.

![image](https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/put-computer-memory-ddr-ram-in-the-slot-of-motherboard-picture-id854429666)

Once both sides of your memory stick sits flush with the DIMM slot, use even pressure and push down on the stick to lock it in.
- don't be afraid to do this. Put two fingers on each side of the stick and go straight down.
- You should hear two clicks when it's fully locked in.

![image](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/inserting-ram.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=2400&dpr=1.5)

If your memory is fully installed, you should see the tabs on the side should close back.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/925461271430717450/unknown.png)

Congratulations! You've installed your memory.

### **[Click me to go to the next step!](https://github.com/Duck-Inc/PC-Building-Guide/blob/main/GUIDE.md#installing-the-cooler)**

### Installing **two** sticks of Memory

![image](https://media.pangoly.com/img/a/c/7/9/ac79f8ec-3b6d-4c79-b382-ff09afb5d32e.jpg)

Open your motherboard's manual and locate the RAM/Memory installation section. It should tell you to install the memory in either slots A1, A2, B1, or B2.
- For some motherboards, you can see where to install two sticks of memory directly.

![image](https://www.build-gaming-computers.com/images/where-to-install-dual-channel-ram-modules.jpg)

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/925453517320253480/unknown.png)

Once you've located which slots you should install the memory stick in, locate the tabs on the side.

![image](https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/2AmLDGOD5TgqUjSG.medium)

For the slot that you'll be installing your memory stick in, open the tabs on both ends by gently pushing them away from the memory slot.
- If you cannot open one of the tabs, then your motherboard was designed to only open one tab. You can move on to the next step if you've confirmed it won't budge.
  - If it won't open and was designed to open both tabs, it may be damaged/manufacturer had a bad day.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/925454731487359046/unknown.png)

### **[Click me to go to the next step!](https://github.com/Duck-Inc/PC-Building-Guide/blob/main/GUIDE.md#installing-the-cooler)**

### Installing **four** sticks of Memory

![image](https://www.gskill.com/_upload/images/156283150611.png)

For 4 sticks of memory, you can just fill up each DIMM slot with one stick.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/925453517320253480/unknown.png)

### Intel Stock Cooler installation

![image](https://www.techpowerup.com/img/F1SUkJmaJ1f1QZbZ.jpg)

Take the cooler and align the 4 legs with the holes on your motherboard. you'll find those around your processor's socket.
- Make sure the cooler's sticker on the fan is facing straight.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/919365882839441448/unknown.png)

Once the legs of the cooler are properly aligned with the holes, push down on the tabs to lock the cooler in.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/919367629205012490/unknown.png)

Finally, plug in the cooler's cable to the header named **CPU_FAN**.
- This cable only goes in one way, so if it won't budge, flip it around and try again.

![image](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746749543881637959/919368398159347812/unknown.png)

Congratulations! You've installed an Intel stock cooler. **[Click me to go to the next step!](https://github.com/Duck-Inc/PC-Building-Guide/blob/main/GUIDE.md#installing-the-cooler)**
- Feel free to tuck the cable underneath the heatsink.

### AMD Wraith Stealth/Spire

![image](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61wVm-etdrL._AC_SL1500_.jpg)

On your motherboard, look at your processor's socket. To the top and bottom of it, you should see two mounting brackets parallel to each other.
