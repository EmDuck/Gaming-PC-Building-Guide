# Picking your parts

![image](https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/06LiQJzDE1OdJcUdbgqwz1X-15..v1569470572.jpg)

Ah yes, part picking. Such a simple yet controversial topic in the PC building community. You may ask, "Well, which part is the most important out of all of them? Which one should I dump all my cash on?" Well, sorry to be so straightforward, but every part is equally important. Each part plays an important role in your system, and skimping out on just one could make you regret it.

**How to pick your parts:** Ask Discord servers in their #build-help channels (don't be that fucker that spams #general with questions). Some active and reliable servers will be listed down here:

- [PC PARADISE](https://discord.gg/pcparadise)
- [PC Building 101](https://discord.gg/Etzp7H9T)
- **PC HELP HUB** (For this server, you will need to go to "Explore Public Servers" on the bottom of your servers list, then type "PC Help Hub".)

Obviously there are more servers out there, but speaking from experience, these three tech servers are what I would recommend you start with. If you have any trouble using [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/), you can always ask the help channels for support.

"I really want some recommendations though..."

Fine, here.
