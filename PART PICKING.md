The most asked question about part picking is, "Which part is the most important?" Well, every part is equally important. Each part plays an important role in your system, and skimping out on just one could make you regret it.

**How to pick your parts:** Ask discord servers in their build-help channels. Some active and reliable servers will be listed down here:
- PC PARADISE https://discord.gg/pcparadise
- PC HELP HUB https://discord.gg/fCsPAfuaHQ
- PC Building 101 https://discord.gg/Etzp7H9T

**Disclaimer: we are not sponsored by these servers, these are just some good ass servers lol**
