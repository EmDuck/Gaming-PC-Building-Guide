# Part Picking
## Part picking is an overlooked part of custom PC building. It can seem easy to just mix parts together and call it a day, but there are several other factors that you want to pay attention to.
### (I would recommend using https://pcpartpicker.com for creating PC part lists. It checks for compatibility issues, is always being updated, automatically links products and their prices, and has a huge variety of parts.

# Tools needed

### YOU WILL NEED:
- 1x Screwdriver 
  - You'll need a philips head screwdriver, you can find these on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=philips+head+screwdrivers&crid=1SDNETJCKJ11F&sprefix=philips+head+%2Caps%2C83&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_4_13) for cheap. Preferrably, you want a magnetic/electrical screwdriver to make things easier, but a standard screwdriver will do.

- 1x Desk/Flat surface (OPTIONAL: Desk mat)
  - Please don't build a PC on the floor or on carpet. Screws get lost easily especially on carpet.

- 1x Screw Tray
  - You can use a dinner plate to hold your screws, it really doesn't matter. Just find something to organize your screws with.

Like I said, there really aren't that many things you need for building a PC. With that established, let's begin!

# Building the PC:

Let's start with the motherboard. Take the motherboard out of the box it came with. It should come in a bag. don't open the bag and take the physical motherboard out. Instead, gently lay it down on an open space on your working area.

Next up, check the rest of the box for accessories. You should find a bunch of them stashed away in there.

## YOU WILL (most likely) FIND:
### **IO Shield**

- This is the IO Shield. On the upper left of your motherboard, you'll see a bunch of ports. The IO shield protects these ports, and also acts as a shield against dust. Take this out of the box.
  - If you don't find one, it's probably already attached to your motherboard.
  - If you don't find one at all, don't worry. The IO shield is mainly for aesthetics, and not having one won't mess with the PC.

### **A bag of 1 pair/2 pairs of tiny metal screws and cylinders**

- These are the M.2 device screws and standoffs. If you are using any M.2 devices such as M.2 SSDs, M.2 Wi-Fi adapters, and more, then you'll need these. Take this out of the box.
  - If you are not using any M.2 devices, you'll not need these. If you are using M.2 devices and cannot find them, you'll have to purchase some third-party replacement ones from a retailer/used seller.

### **Foldable antennas/Non-Foldable antenna with cable**

- These are the Wi-Fi antennae. They extend the Wi-Fi signal and are meant to boost Wi-Fi performance. If your motherboard comes with built-in Wi-Fi, then you'll see this device included with your motherboard. Take this out of the box.
  - If you don't find this, your motherboard does not have with built-in Wi-Fi, or your motherboard may have built-in antennae or comes with them pre-attached.
  - If you plan on using a wired connection such as ethernet, you don't need to worry about this.

### **Cables**
![image](https://cdn.sabrent.com/uploads/CB-SFR3-Main.jpg)
- These cables are the SATA-DATA cables. If you have any SATA devices that require these cables such as hard drives or SATA SSDs, you'll need these cables. Take them out of the motherboard.
  - If you don't find these cables and have SATA devices that require these cables, you'll have to purchase some third-party replacement ones from a retailer/used seller.

### **Paper**
![image](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/user-manual-7076290.jpg)
- This is your motherboard manual. you'll need to use this as a reference for the build. Take this out of the box.
  - If you don't have a manual, you can find it at the manufacturer's website. Type in the model of your motherboard and look for the board's manual download, then open the PDF for your reference.
  - Anything else that you find made out of paper will probably be a quick start guide, a sticker, warranty notes, or a thank you note. You don't have to worry about those.

### **A disk**

- This is a DVD drive for your motherboard's drivers. I wouldn't recommend using this to install your motherboard's drivers because, one, it's probably out of date, as product manufacturers will have products sitting around for months on end until someone orders it, and two, you'll need to add an optical disk drive to your system, and that can be a pain and is unnecessary for more modern systems. Just let it sit in the box for now.
  - If you don't have this, don't worry. You'll install drivers for your motherboard later from the manufacturer's website either way.

### Once you find everything you need, head on to the next step. Close the motherboard box fully, and get your motherboard. Gently open the bag, and lay the motherboard down on top of the box, it provides a nice elevated surface to get started on.
